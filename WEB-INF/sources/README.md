## Compilation

To compile the java files, add `mysql-connector-java-5.0.8-bin.jar` and `servlet-api.jar` to the class path.
To compile ReportSignatureReader, add the above along with `SignatureReader.class` to the class path.
Add these compiled files to the path /sources/classes. These were compiled on Java 1.7.
